RetinaDisplayMaster
===================

*Update:* The latest version of this project is now at https://github.com/avibrazil/RDM/pull/4. I incorporated my fixes into the most-Googled RDM version. Download the `zip` file of the repository, rather than using the `.pkg` link at the bottom of the README---the link has not yet been updated.

***

A utility to enable full control over resolution on Macs with retina displays, including 1:1 display modes.

To use, download the compressed version from Github, unzip, and run the script `installer.sh`. It will build the executable file and move the application to the system's Applications folder.

This program is provided for free and without any warranty or support.  By using this software, you agree to not hold us liable for any loss or damage.
