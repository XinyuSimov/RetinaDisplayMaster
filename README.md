RetinaDisplayMaster
===================

A utility to enable full control over resolution on Macs with retina displays, including 1:1 display modes.

To use, download the compressed version from Github, unzip, and rename the root folder (the one containing only Contents/ and documentation files) to RetinaDisplayMaster.app so that it's understood by the system as an application.

This program is provided for free and without any warranty or support.  By using this software, you agree to not hold us liable for any loss or damage.
